K8s

1.K8s is in Cluster in nature
generally installed ass a cluster (group of nodes)

so when one of the container is using high cpu it will affect other container load will split---> 

so k8s will solve it --> if any faulty node something like cpu issue it will automatically chnage the node ---asign the application to other node

2. Autoscaling-- when ever the container need to increase the container and split the load like load balancing --
k8s there is feature called HPA horizontal pod autoscaling --it will increse it automatically

3.Auto healing

k8s controls and fix the damage--> container is going down--> Auto healing using this feature even before container goes down it will 
 create or restart the containers --api server will rollout new a container --end use will not get to know container has goes down recreated
 
4.Enterprise levl support - origanated from google--parts of borg -->

Enterprise levl container orchestration platform--docker doens have the capabilities so docker will do do in producation since its not a enterprise level support

basically roundrobin extend to any level
custom resources/ u install ur lb from side 

podman promethues in cncf -k8s community or tools in k8s

by default not support advanced level load balancing --ingress--create k8s controlleer and use lb --ingress
