Docker is ephmeral in nature
1.Single host ---> if a single contains multiple containers like 100- incase one of the conatainer is exhausted the memory it will affect each other---so disavandtage of docker

2.Auto healing is not happening in docker
since user killed container -->app--> not accessible-->auto healing not happening --container not coming automatically
100 reason of container can go down--doevops engineer cant monitor 1000s containers

3.Auto scaling not do in docker

example 1 container having 4 cpu /4gb ram--> suddenly when the occasion comes xmas so user increased from 10000 to 1lakhs- so automaticaally it will increase

manually increase container from 1 to 10 containers or automatically -- so if 2 container or 3--it should do load balancing -
automatically its not hapeening in docker -manually we can increase the count

4.Enterprise level support
Docker doesnt support --> Enterprise level support (without load balance/firewall/auto healing/healing/api gateway)
