Secure k8s

1.Secure your api server
2.RBAC
3.Network policies
4.Encrypted at rest ETCD
5.Secure container
6. Cluster monitoring
7. Frequent upgrade


1.Secure your api server 
Need high availability - like 3 master nodes

 everyone can access your cluster or hack using api server
 so tls certificates required for secure your applications
 like https --
 tls cerificates can be add using adding in mydaddy
 
---
so kubectl get pods
kube-apiserver
using kube-system namespace
 using pod.yaml with below config
 spec:
 container
 tls certificates
 private
 client
 
 ---
 restrict the access RBAC -role based access control
 depending on the role 
 service/role/cluster role binding
 
 xyz user -accesing the cluster - create a cluster role and give resource level access like set and watch the pods
 
 
 2. RBAC
 service account -- give the access to the services like configmap/jenkins/ or any other service required to access ur k8s cluster 
 users- need to access the k8s cluster 
 
 rbac is basically like act as a IAM users/groups
  role
  cluster role binding
  
  3. network policies
